# Beautiful GeeksForGeeks

A Chrome extension to remove the annoying left and right sidebars from GeeksForGeeks article pages. It doesn't disable the sidebars on the homepage, so navigation is not hampered. However, article pages are stripped of all sidebars. They are not very useful anyway :stuck_out_tongue:
